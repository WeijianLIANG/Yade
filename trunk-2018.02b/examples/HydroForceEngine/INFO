The folder example of HydroForceEngine contains three different type of examples: 
- One-way coupling examples, meaning that the fluid is imposed and the HydroForceEngine is used only to apply fluid forces (drag and buoyancy) on the particles from the 1D prescribed fluid profile and the fluid properties. These are: buoyantParticles.py, fluidizedBed.py and sedimentTransportExample.py. In the latter, the HydroForceEngine is also used to evaluate 1D volume-averaged solid depth profiles, which can be plotted with postProcessing_sedim.py
- A two-way coupling example (sedimentTransportExample_1DRANSCoupling.py), which consider the exact same configuration as sedimentTransportExample_1DRANSCoupling.py but include a resolution of the volume-averaged 1D fluid momentum balance, i.e. a so-called 1D RANS coupling to the DEM. This coupling is the one that has been used in the papers Maurin et al (2015,2016), which can be found in the references. HydroForceEngine is therefore used here to apply the fluid forces (drag and buoyancy) on the particles from a given 1D fluid profile (basic function of HydroForceEngine when activated), evaluate 1D volume-averaged solid depth profiles (velocity, volume fraction, drag force; averageProfile() function of HydroForceEngine), and solve the 1D volume-averaged fluid momentum (fluidModel function of HydroForceEngine) from the averaged solid quantities determined.
- Fluid resolution validation examples, which does not include particles and consider classical validation for the 1D fluid momentum balance resolution, i.e. poiseuille flow and logarithmic profiles. These scripts use only the fluidModel function of HydroForceEngine.
